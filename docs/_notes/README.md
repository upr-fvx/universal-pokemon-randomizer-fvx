# Notes

This folder contains assorted notes, created as part of the development. They are meant for developers of the Randomizer, and other ROM hacking tools. 

Since development of the Randomizer often requires exploring data structures / code present in the ROMs, making notes as you go is a useful tactic. Usually, only the final results of the notes taken make it into the Randomizer's code, but then some of these notes would be a waste to discard. They both elucidate details about the ROMs, and the process of digging them out. As such they could be of use for future developers, to get a grip of ROM hacking tool development. And thus they are included here. 

## Adding to the folder

If you made especially nice notes while developing the Randomizer, feel free to put them here. **Don't use this as an excuse to under-document the code itself though!** 

Also, *especially nice* is a key term, the notes should explain *why* they were made, and *what* they contain.  

## This folder is hidden

Yes it is true, the contents of this folder are not visible for now, *unless* one is digging around in the source code (like you!). And this despite being inside the `docs`/website folder. This is because it is barren for now, at the time of writing there's only one (1) note, and that's not really worth showing off. If/when more notes are added, it should be made visible on the website.
