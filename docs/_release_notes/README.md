This folder contains release notes for each version of 
the Universal Pok√©mon Randomizer FVX. It also contains 
a sketch of the release notes for the upcoming version,
and a release note template.

When making changes to the Randomizer, please update
RELEASE_NOTE-next.md appropriately. And then, when it
is time to release a new version, finalize it, rename 
it RELEASE_NOTE-v[version id].md and copy its text to 
GitHub's release interface.
Then, create a new RELEASE_NOTE_next.md through copying
the template.

Changelogs for ZX are also included, though these are 
in a different format.
