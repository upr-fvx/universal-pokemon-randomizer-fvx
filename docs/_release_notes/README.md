This folder contains release notes for each version of 
the Universal Pokémon Randomizer FVX. It also contains 
a sketch of the release notes for the upcoming version,
and a release note template.

When making changes to the Randomizer, please update
`release-note-next.md` appropriately. And then, when it
is time to release a new version, finalize it, rename 
it `v[version id].md` and copy its text to 
GitHub's release interface.
Then, create a new `release-note-next.md` through copying
the template.

Older release notes are also included, in the `old/` folder.
