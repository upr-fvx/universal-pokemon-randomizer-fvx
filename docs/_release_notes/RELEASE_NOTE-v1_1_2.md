The last release accidentally caused some crashes with alternate forms, notable in Platinum and beyond. This release should fix that, and some other stuff too! Thanks to @TopOfAllWorlds for reporting the bug!

# Changelog
## New and Changed Features
### Evolutions
- (Gen 7) "Change Impossible Evolutions" now adds evolution to Kanto forms using a Moon Stone in Sun and Moon.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed crash when using any setting that carries some attribute up evolutions (base stats, types, abilities, TM/HM/move tutor compatibility, palettes), in games with alternate forms. 
- (Gen 5) Fixed Cheren's starter being in the wrong position, in his second battle in Black/White. 
- (Gen 7) Fixed the first encounter on Route 1 (lvl 4 Pikipek in Vanilla). It now matches the encounters on that route, instead of being counted as a Static Pok√©mon.
- Fixed wiki links within the Randomizer UI.
