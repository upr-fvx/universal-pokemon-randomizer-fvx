**Note:** Apparently, random Pokémon palettes are broken for Gen 4+5 games. This has been fixed for the next release, but until then v1.1.0 is recommended for anyone who wants to use this feature.

Here comes a Christmas release! It adds the option to make HMs forgettable in Generations 1, 2, 3, and 5, and support for Type Effectiveness randomization in Gen 6. Thanks to totally_anonymous and drayano60 on the Kingdom of DS Hacking Discord server, for the Gen 5 implementation!

# How to use

Download the Randomizer below by clicking on `UPR_FVX-v1.1.3.zip`. After downloading, extract the contents of the zip file to a folder on your computer. You can then run the Randomizer by double clicking the appropriate launcher script:

- Windows: Use `launcher_WINDOWS.bat`
- Mac: Use `launcher_MAC.command`
- Other Unix-based systems: Use `launcher_UNIX.sh`
