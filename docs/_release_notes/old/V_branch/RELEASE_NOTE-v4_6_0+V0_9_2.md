Here's another release, focused on custom player graphics. 

Touched up GUI stuff, fixed some bugs, and added support for custom player characters to the remaining vanilla Gen I & II games. So `Blue (S)`, `Silver(I)`, and `Crystal(J)`, etc. Japanese R/G/B/Y are the exception, since those games are really short on free memory.
