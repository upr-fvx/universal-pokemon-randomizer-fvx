A relatively minor release, but still worth putting out.

Trainers:
- fixed the weirdness with Emerald's Sootopolis Steven. This was less of an actual bug, and more of a debugging misreport.

Items:
- "Randomize Special Shops" can now be used in Gen 2

Graphics:
- "Player Character Sprites" can now change player colors in Gen 2.
- fixed (?) not being able to use "Player Character Sprites" in Gen 2. For some reason it works for me now, when it did not before, really mystifying. Try using the launcher if it does not work for you. I'm still interested in any knowledge on Java's JNA Library, Lunar Compress, or Gen 2's compression algorithm, since ultimately depending on DLLs is kind of shakey, and hurts Linux support.
