A quick release, so the custom player graphics and random palettes can be tried out. A fuller description of the V branch changes will come with +V1.0.0, when the custom player graphics are done in all generations I-V. 

Most importantly, custom player graphics should be fully implemented in Red(U) and Blue(U).
