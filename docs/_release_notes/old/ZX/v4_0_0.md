# Changes

---
## General

- New Distribution Format

The randomizer is now distributed as a zip file instead of just a jar file. **Make sure to read the included README (it is not very long).**

- GitHub Wiki

There is now a [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki) with some [important information](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki/Important-Information) and some extracurricular information.

- Generation 6/7 Support

The randomizer now supports Generation 6/7 games, specifically:

```
X/Y
Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire
Sun/Moon
Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon
```

Because 3DS game randomization is a little more complicated than the earlier consoles, there is a [Wiki page with some helpful information about 3DS games.](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx/wiki/Randomizing-the-3DS-games)

- Game Update Support

For Gen 6-7 games, Game Updates can be applied by clicking Settings -> Load Game Update.

- Loading Settings Strings

The option to load settings from a string instead of a file has been added. Getting your current settings as a string and loading settings from a string can be done by going to Settings -> Get/Load Settings String.

- Changes to Premade Seeds

Generating a premade seed using a seed + a config string can now be done without having the same set of custom names as the original creator of the seed. This will result in the same randomization, but with different custom names (if the custom names setting is used). To generate a premade seed that uses the same custom names, have the original creator generate a preset file (.rndp) instead.

## Pokemon Traits

### Pokemon Base Statistics

- Setting: Update Base Stats

Now called "Update Base Stats to Generation". Allows for choosing which generation to update base stats to. Choosing a later generation will include the updates from previous generations as well.

- **NEW:** Follow Mega Evolutions

Mega Evolutions inherit their stat distributions from their base formes. Similarly to regular Evolutions, split Mega Evolutions will not inherit stat distributions.

### Pokemon Types

- **NEW:** Follow Mega Evolutions

Mega Evolutions inherit their typing from their base formes. Similarly to regular Evolutions, split Mega Evolutions will not inherit typings.

### Pokemon Abilities

- **NEW:** Combine Duplicate Abilities

When randomizing abilities, considers abilities with the exact same effect to be the same ability for probability purposes. Every variation of these abilities can still appear.

- **NEW:** Follow Mega Evolutions

Mega Evolutions inherit their randomized abilities from their base formes. Similarly to regular Evolutions, split Mega Evolutions will not inherit abilities.

### Pokemon Evolutions

- Setting: Make Evolutions Easier

This setting will now always lower the evolution level of intermediate evolutions to 30. (Previously, it was only lowered if the next evolution also was level based.)

- Nincada's Evolutions

Randomizing Evolutions will now properly randomize Nincada's "Shedinja Evolution" in all generations. Additionally, the "Ninjask Evolution" will now inherit its traits from Nincada if "Follow Evolutions" settings are used.

- **NEW:** Allow Alternate Formes

Gen 7 only. Allows alternate formes of Pokemon to appear as Evolutions.

### Other

- Alternate Formes

In Black 2/White 2, Pokemon traits (base stats, typing, ability, EXP curves, etc) are now set correctly for alternate formes.

- Keldeo (Resolute Forme)

In generation 5, Keldeo-R is now treated as a cosmetic form and will have the same base stat spread/typing/ability/moves as regular Keldeo.

When randomizing trades in Gen 4/5, the text boxes describing what Pokemon the person wants/gives are now changed correctly.

## Moves & Movesets

## Misc Tweaks

- **NEW:** All Wild Pokemon Can Call Allies

Gen 5 only. Sets fossil levels in BW to 20 instead of 25. More level balancing may be added in the future.

- **NEW:** Don't Revert Temporary Alt Formes

Gen 6/7 only. Some alternate formes of Pokemon will revert to their base forme when the game is reset (or, in Gen 7 only, at the end of battles); this setting prevents this from happening.
