- Added a system to ban "bad"/useless items from the various item randomizers available.
  - This means you can safely randomize items in later games without being buried under berries and mail.
  - The definition of a useless item changes from game to game but generally includes stuff not useful for in-game battles.
- Banned Thief from randomized movesets in Gen 2 specifically.
  - This change is made to prevent Trainer/Wild Pokemon permanently stealing the player's held items.
  - You can still find Thief to use yourself from a TM or Move Tutor.
- Added another small hack to fix stone evolutions for National Dex mons in FR/LG.
- Made a few changes to the gen3 handler to improve ROM hack compatibility.
  - The randomizer now detects (and mostly ignores) circular evolutions seen in some ROM hacks.
  - Support for ROM hacks that have had additional maps/banks added in AdvanceMap has been added.
  - Improved detection of invalid pointers slightly.
- Added a code tweak for gen3 games to use running shoes indoors.
