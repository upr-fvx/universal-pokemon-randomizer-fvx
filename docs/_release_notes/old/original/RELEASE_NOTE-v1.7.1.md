- Allow carrying _shuffled_ base stats up evolutions as well as randomized ones.
  - Carrying shuffled stats up evolutions just means that the same reordering will be used for each Pokemon in the evolutionary tree.
  - As usual, these will not be carried up split evolutions.
- Allow carrying randomized abilities up evolutions as well.
  - The randomized abilities will be 100% identical for each Pokemon in a given evolutionary tree, except split evolutions.
- Added two new options that remove certain undesirable groups of abilities from the list that randomized abilities are picked from.
  - You can choose to ban 100% negative abilities (Slow Start, Defeatist, Truant) and trapping abilities (Arena Trap, Magnet Pull, Shadow Tag).
- Added an option to modify randomized movesets so damaging moves are acquired in order of their power, from weakest to strongest.
  - The positions of non-damaging moves in a Pokemon's moveset are unaffected by this option.
- You can now choose to force a certain proportion of levelup, TM and HM moves to be "good damaging moves".
  - Good damaging moves are classified as moves with 50+ power and 90%+ accuracy, or 100+ power with any accuracy.
  - Each proportion can be set separately, and if the option is disabled entirely then move choice will be the same as previous versions.
  - Note that the proportion you set is an added chance and not a guarantee. A Pokemon can still get lucky and get a higher proportion even without using the option, such is the nature of randomization.
- Added an option to update Pokemon base stats, which applies the changes made in Gen 6 to Gen 1-5 Pokemon stats (at least the ones available in the game you are playing)
  - If you use this option for a Gen 1 game, then changes to Attack, Defense and Speed will be applied as normal but changes to Special Attack/Defense will depend on which stat the Special turned into in Gen 2.
- Trainer Pokemon can now be forced to be fully evolved above a certain level, which you decide.
  - With this option off, Trainer Pokemon randomization will act as usual. But if it is on, it takes precedence other all other modifiers applied.
- Allow using "Rival Carries Starter" option even if trainers aren't randomized.
  - You must still at least change one of the starters or the trainers, otherwise using this option would be completely pointless.
- To improve trainers in randomized games in general, their held items are no longer removed and their moves are only reset if the Pokemon is actually randomized.
  - So you can rest easy knowing that the game won't suddenly become a cakewalk just because you wanted the rival to use a different starter.
- Added a slider to the "Minimum Catch Rate" option so you can choose just how easy Pokemon will be to catch.
  - Level 1 is the same as the old option. Levels 2 and 3 make catches progressively easier, while Level 4 gives everything the same catch rate as Pidgey/Rattata.
- The tweak that allows out-of-KantoDex Pokemon to be evolved in FireRed/LeafGreen will now be applied when you remove impossible evolutions.
  - This means you can choose to only remove trade evolutions and play an otherwise unrandomized game but still evolve the likes of Onix before receiving the National Dex.
- Balancing for the "Randomize Move Powers" option has been updated to take the average hit count of the move being randomized into account.
  - In practice, this means that 2+ hit moves will no longer be ridiculously OP on average when randomized. They should be roughly equal to everything else now.
  - Scaling is done based on the average hit count rather than the maximum hit count, so 2-5 hit moves can still be quite powerful if they hit 5 times.
- Reduced the average accuracy of OHKO moves when "Randomize Move Accuracies" is used even further.
  - These moves will no longer ever have 100% accuracy, and they will only break 50% very rarely.
- Added an option to ban Lucky Egg from randomized item lists, due to how badly it breaks game balance.
  - If the game gives you a Lucky Egg from an NPC/as part of the plot, that will still remain the case if you use this option.
- Improved Gen 2 static Pokemon randomization slightly.
  - If a static Pokemon plays its cry before battling you, that cry will now be updated to match the randomized replacement Pokemon.
- Fixed the bug where the selection of "Full HM Compatibility" was not being loaded from settings files.
  - This setting still worked in 1.7.0x, but if you loaded a Quick Settings file it would be set off by default. Now it will be loaded correctly.
- Fixed a bug that made the combination of "Area 1-to-1 Encounters" and the "Type Themed" modifier always fail to randomize.
- Fix handling of Japanese Gen 1/2 games to not have a chance to bug out when the user tries to randomize trainer names/class names.
  -  These options are now unavailable entirely for Japanese Gen1/2, as was the original intention. Later gens allow name randomization regardless of language.
- Fixed a bug where quite a few Gen 3 methods would not randomize the last Pokemon in the National Dex correctly.
