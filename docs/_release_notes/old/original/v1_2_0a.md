 - The "Purrloin Patch": The 5th generation games crash when you open the Pokedex if it has no Unova Pokemon registered as seen at all. To overcome this, the randomizer now gives you a free "seen" entry for Patrat or Purrloin when you get the Pokedex. This also makes sense as these Pokemon are the ones which you are shown how to catch in Black/White and Black2/White2 respectively.
 - The roamers (Raikou/Entei/Suicine in G/S only) are now randomized in Generation 2 games.
 - Trainer names in Generation 2 games are now limited to 10 characters again to fix a text corruption bug.
 - Pokemon in Generation 2 games will no longer flee when encountered randomized.
 - Fixed TM01 DYNAMIC-PUNCH text not being updated when TMs are randomized in Crystal.
 - A problem with randomizing FireRed/LeafGreen starter Pokemon has been temporarily fixed.
 - The "Update Moves" function now works when randomizing Pokemon Platinum.
 - Removed need for a separate release without update checks. There will now be a packaged file to boot up the randomizer without an update check included with normal releases.
