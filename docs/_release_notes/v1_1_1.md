# Changelog
## New and Changed Features
### Evolutions
- (Gen 7) Rockruff and Cosmoem no longer have their evolutions changed always, instead these changes are tied to "Change Impossible Evolutions"/"Make Evolutions Easier"/"Remove Time-based Evolutions" like with other Pok√©mon. [More info here](https://upr-fvx.github.io/universal-pokemon-randomizer-fvx/wikipages/evolutions.html).

### Graphics
- (Gen 2) Custom Player Graphics of Red, by Pokeli. 

## Bugfixes

- Fixed crash when attempting to assign weakness-reducing berry for the Normal type, as a consequence of changed type effectiveness creating a weakness to the Normal type.
- Fixed alternate formes being ignored by parts of the Randomizer. When base stats/types/abilities/TM compability are randomized, alt formes will have those attributes randomized as well. Since Mega Evolutions count as alt formes,  this is what caused them to not get random abilities.
