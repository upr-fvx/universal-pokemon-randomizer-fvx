**Note:** Apparently, random Pokémon palettes are broken for Gen 4+5 games. This has been fixed for the next release, but until then v1.1.0 is recommended for anyone who wants to use this feature.

Here comes a Christmas release! It adds the option to make HMs forgettable in Generations 1, 2, 3, and 5, and support for Type Effectiveness randomization in Gen 6. Thanks to totally_anonymous and drayano60 on the Kingdom of DS Hacking Discord server, for the Gen 5 implementation!
