# Changelog
## New and Changed Features
### Wild Pokémon

- (Gen 7) Wild encounter areas are now sorted in the log, according to location, and the expected order for the player to visit said locations. Encounters for Route 1 are listed first, then Hau'oli City, Route 2, etc...

### Misc.

- Failure to log the randomization results, no longer causes a full crash/inability to save the randomized game.

## Bugfixes

- (Gen 3) Fix minor FireRed ROM hacks not being able to load. (Randomizing ROM hacks is still done at own risk, but binary hacks that e.g. just swap out a few sprites, have been supported by previous Randomizer versions, and FVX should not break that tradition).
- (Gen 6) Fix crash due to logger not accounting for InGameTrade.requestedSpecies == null
- (Gen 7) Fix crash when logging Totem Pokémon
