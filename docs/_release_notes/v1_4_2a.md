Hi! This release aims to lessen the impact of a bug introduced last version, which prevented the Randomizer from launching at all on some Windows setups. 

Thanks to @AxelElric8 for reporting the Issue, and everyone else who has participated in the discussion (@Pokepal7, @UserNotFound32, @mememan498, and @Gabbyxo97) for your valuable insights, including finding a temporary fix!

# How to use

Download the Randomizer below by clicking on `UPR_FVX-v1.4.2a.zip`. After downloading, extract the contents of the 
zip file to a folder on your computer. You can then run the Randomizer by double-clicking the appropriate launcher script:

- Windows: Use `launcher_WINDOWS.bat`
- Mac: Use `launcher_MAC.command`
- Other Unix-based systems: Use `launcher_UNIX.sh`

## Bugfixes
- Made failure to setup the Windows theme, no longer prevent the Randomizer from opening. Instead, it should only disable the Windows theme. (#159)
