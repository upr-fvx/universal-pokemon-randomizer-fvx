name: Custom Player Graphics
---

The FVX branch has support for custom player graphics (CPG) in the Gen 1-3 games. Basically, this means that you can take a pack of images, and replace the ones in the game with them. The UPR comes pre-packed with some custom player graphics to try out, but you can also make your own quite easily. 
 
This feature was inspired in part by a similar feature in [The A Link to the Past Randomizer](https://alttpr.com/en), and in part by people on Reddit and Discord servers wanting to easily change the player character, and only it. The UPR already had some customizer features like setting specific starters, and disabling trade evolutions, so it seemed a natural fit.

Below is a general guide for how CPGs work, followed by sections for specific games/Generations.

* [In all games](#in-all-games)
* [In Generation 1](#in-generation-1)
* [In Generation 2](#in-generation-2)
* [In Generation 3 (general)](#in-generation-3-general)
* [In Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald](#in-rubysapphireemerald)
* [In FireRed/LeafGreen](#in-fireredleafgreen)

## In all games

### File structure
To add a CPG, create a new folder within `data/players/`, e.g. `data/players/my_cpg`. This folder should contain:

- Image and/or palette file(s) containing the graphics. This can be a single sheet (recommended), or multiple images + palettes.
- A text file called `info.ini`, containing some info about the custom player graphics, such as who made it, and also how to use the graphics file(s).

![the randomizer's root folder, with data/ highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/nav1.png)

![the data/ folder, with players/ highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/nav2.png)

![the players/ folder, with snorlax/ highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/nav3.png)

![the snorlax/ folder, showing image files and info.ini]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/nav4.png)

The simplest way of making a CPG is using a sheet, since they encompass all graphics info needed, in a single image file. Each RomType (what game the CPG are meant for) has its own example/template sheet, presented in their own sections below. The only thing sheets can't do, but separate graphics files can, is Gen 3 reflection palette shenanigans. Sheets also have the advantage, of being easy to upload to websites such as [Spriter's Resource](https://www.spriters-resource.com/) or [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/).

![a Gen 1 sheet for Snorlax]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/example_sheet.png)

The UPR accepts images in many formats, but ".png" and ".bmp" are strongly recommended. Don't use ".jpg" files. If you know what "indexing" images is, do not worry about that. Unindexed images work just fine, as long as they don't have too many colors. This means you can use pretty much any image editing tool to create the images, like MS Paint or [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) (the exception where indexing is needed, is Gen 3 overworld sprites, *if a sheet is not used*).

Normally the palettes are taken from the image files, the exception being the reflection palette in Gen 3 games, *if a sheet is not used*. In that case, they should be ".pal" files in JASC-PAL format. 

The `info.ini` file can contain one or more custom player graphics entries. Each of these entries has a name in square brackets, followed by a number of tags. Each tag has a key, followed by "=", and a value. For example, if you have "RomType=Gen1", that means the custom player graphics are meant for inserting into a Gen 1 game. 

### Example

Below is an example of the contents of a info.ini file. Double slashes "//" can be used for comments.

```
[Snorlax]
RomType=Gen1
Description=The Pokémon known for blocking roads.
From=Pokémon - Generation I
Creator=Gamefreak
Adapter=Voliol
Category=POKEMON
FrontImage=gb_front.png
BackImage=gb_back.png
WalkSprite=gb_walk.png
BikeSprite=gb_bike.png
FishSpriteMode=combined
FishSprite=gb_fish.png

[Snorlax]
RomType=Gen2 // Note this is different from "RomType=Gen1" above. 
Description=The Pokémon known for blocking roads.
From=Pokémon - Generation I
Creator=Gamefreak
Adapter=Voliol
Category=POKEMON
Sheet=sheet.png
```

### List of tags

Below is a table of common tags, what values they accept, and what they are used for. Depending on the RomType/what game the custom player graphics are meant for, there are also additional tags, like "UnderwaterSprite" or "FishSpriteMode". The generation-specific pages explain what these tags are. 

It *is* possible to use tags meant for separate graphics files, in addition to a sheet. In which case, the sheet is loaded first, and the other tags overwrite the contents of the sheet.

<tr><td>RomType</td>
	<td>Gen1, Gen2, RSE, FRLG</td> 
	<td>What game the custom player graphics are meant for. Gen1 is for any Generation I game, Gen2 for any Generation II game, RSE for Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, and FRLG for FireRed/LeafGreen.<br><br>The kinds of images needed depends on the RomType. Read more on the generation-specific pages.</td></tr>

## In Generation 1

[Showcase gif]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/showcase.gif)

### General info

Due to the Gen 1 games being for the original GameBoy, all graphics are monochrome, with 4 shades. The UPR can detect the shades used in your images, so as long as your image contains no more than four colors, it will be fine. You do not have to index the palette.

For overworld sprites, the lightest color in the source image is used for "transparent", instead of "white".

The example below shows that both source images (colored and monochrome) give the same result when inserted into the game.

![a colored source image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_walk_colored.png) or ![a monochrome source image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_walk.png) &rarr; ![a screenshot of the resulting sprite in-game]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_screenshot.png)

### Sheet examples/info

Below are sheet examples for Gen 1, one filled in and one blank. They should be mostly self-explanatory. It it recommended you use one of them, when making a Gen 1 sheet.

![a Gen 1 sheet for Professor Oak]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/sheet_example_oak.png) ![a blank Gen 1 sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/sheet_example_blank.png)

Of note:

- Cyan represents transparency.
- The provided palettes should be used; the top-right one for the front/back images, and the bottom-right one for the overworld sprites. This is so the Randomizer can properly parse the sheet. Depending on your emulator settings, the palettes may be different in-game.
- Only the cyan-background parts of the fishing sprites are used. Read more about this in the graphics specifications below.
- Credits can be included inside the sheet image, **below** the main parts of the sheet. Do **not** otherwise pad the image/change its dimensions.

### Graphic specifications

The player has a front image, a back image, and sprites for walking, cycling, and fishing in the overworld.

The front image is 56x56 pixels, and the back image is 32x32 pixels. The bottom 4 rows of pixels of the back image should be white. Examples of valid front and back images below:

![front image #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_front.png)
![front image #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/blackmage_front.png)
![front image #3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/snorlax_front.png)
![front image #4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_front.png)
![back image #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_back.png)
![back image #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/blackmage_back.png)
![back image #3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/snorlax_back.png)
![back image #4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_back.png)

The walk sprite and bike sprite have identical specifications. They are both 16x96 pixels, split into 6 frames of 16x16 pixels each. Examples of valid walk and bike sprites below:

![walk sprite #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_walk.png)
![walk sprite #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/blackmage_walk.png)
![walk sprite #3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/snorlax_walk.png)
![walk sprite #4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_walk.png)
![bike sprite #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_bike.png)
![bike sprite #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/blackmage_bike.png)
![bike sprite #3]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/snorlax_bike.png)
![bike sprite #4]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/mario_bike.png)

Like the walk and bike sprites, the fishing sprite has frames for the directions up/down/side. However, they only have 1 frame for each direction, 
and this frame only covers the bottom half of what is seen on screen. The top half is taken from the walk sprite frame facing the appropriate direction.

![walk sprite with the part seen in screenshot highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_walk_highlight.png) + 
![fishing sprite with the part seen in screenshot highlighted]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_fish_highlight.png) &rarr;
![screenshot of the player fishing ]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/fishing_screenshot.png)

The UPR can read fishing sprites in two "modes". With the "separate" mode, each frame will be read from a separate 8x16 pixel image. 
With the "combined" mode, all frames will be read from a single 16x24 pixel image. This is controlled Examples of valid fishing sprites below:

![fishing sprite separate #1-front]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_fish_front.png)
![fishing sprite separate #1-back]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen1/red_fish_back.png)

## In Generation 2

[Showcase gif]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/showcase.gif)

### General info

Perhaps because the Gen 2 games were originally set up to be playable on the original GameBoy, as well as the GameBoy color, all graphics have 4 colors: "white", "black", and two others. The UPR can detect the shades used in your images, so as long as your image contains no more than four colors, it will be fine. You do not have to index the palette.

For overworld sprites, the lightest color in the source image is used for "transparent", instead of "white".

The example below shows that both source images (colored and monochrome) give the same result when inserted into the game.

![a colored source image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/other_walk.png) or ![a monochrome source image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/other_walk_monochrome.png) &rarr;
![a screenshot of the resulting sprite in-game]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/other_screenshot.png)

What colors are actually used for an image/sprite depends on the palette loaded for it. The front and back images will use the palette of the given front image. The overworld sprites will use one of 8 predefined palettes, chosen in `ini.txt`.

### Sheet examples/info

Below are sheet examples for Gen 2, one filled in and one blank. They should be mostly self-explanatory. It it recommended you use one of them, when making a Gen 2 sheet.

![a Gen 2 sheet for Leaf, credit Molly]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/sheet_example_leaf.png) ![a blank Gen 2 sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/sheet_example_blank.png)

Of note:

- The front/back images should share four colors; two freely chosen ones, in addition to white and black.
- The overworld sprites should use any of the eight given palettes. All overworld sprites must use the same palette.
- In the overworld sprite palettes, cyan represents transparency.
- Only the cyan-background parts of the fishing sprites are used. Read more about this in the graphics specifications below.
- Credits can be included inside the sheet image, **below** the main parts of the sheet. Do **not** otherwise pad the image/change its dimensions.

### Graphic specifications

The player has a front image, a back image, a trainer card image, and sprites for walking, cycling, and fishing in the overworld.

The front image is 56x56 pixels, and the back image is 48x48 pixels. The trainer card image is 40x56 pixels, and normally just a cropped down version of the front image, with a triangle in the corner in Gold/Silver. The UPR knows how to crop down a front image to create a trainer card image, so you don't have to include the latter if you don't want to.

Examples of valid front, back, and trainer card images below. The last trainer card image includes the aforementioned "triangle in the corner":

![front image #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen2/kris_front.png)

## In Generation 3 (general)

### General info

All the customizable player graphics use indexed palettes of size 16. Since 1 color is always used for transparency, this in effect means each image can have up to <b>15</b> colors. 

The transparent color is picked differently depending on whether your source image is a sheet or a separate image. If it is a sheet, see "sheet examples/info" below. 

If it is a separate image, it depends on whether the image is indexed or not. If it is, the color at index 0 will be picked. If it isn't, then the color of pixel in the top right corner will be picked. Generally, this means you don't have to worry about indexing the source image correctly, since the UPR takes care of transparency. However, the overworld sprites mostly use the same palette, so you want to keep track of the palette indexing when working on them.

### Sheet examples/info

Below are four sheet examples for Gen 3, two filled in and two blank, compatible with Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, and FireRed/LeafGreen respectively. They should be mostly self-explanatory. It it recommended you use one of these, when making a RSE/FLRG sheet.

![a RSE sheet for May]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/rse/sheet_example_may.png) ![a blank RSE sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/rse/sheet_example_blank.png)

![a FRLG sheet for Leaf]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/frlg/sheet_example_leaf.png) ![a blank FRLG sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/frlg/sheet_example_blank.png)

Of note:

- Sprites in the same box use the same palette. This means that the sprites in each box, may only use up to 16 colors (15+"transparent"). The palette of each box, is found to the top, or top-right, as strips of color. These palette-strips are what the Randomizer primarily uses to determine the in-game palette, so **it is very important that the palette-strips match the sprites**.
- The first/left-most color of a given palette, represents transparency.
- The big overworld sprites box, may have a second palette above its normal one: this is the reflection palette. If it is erased/drawn over with the sheet's teal background color, the reflection palette will be set to equal the normal palette.
- Credits can be included inside the sheet image, outside the boxes containing the graphics themselves. Do **not** pad the image/change its dimensions.

### Graphic specifications

The player has a front image, a back image, a map icon image, and various sprites (walking, cycling, fishing etc.) used in the overworld.
<br><br>
The front image is 64x64 pixels, and the back image is 64x256 pixels in RSE and 64x320 pixels in FRLG, divided into 4 respectively 5 64x64 pixel frames. Examples of valid front and back images below. The first back image is valid for RSE, and the second for FRLG:

![front image #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/may_front.png)
![front image #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/red_front.png)
![back image #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/may_back.png)
![back image #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/red_back.png)

The map icon image is 16x16 pixels. Examples of valid map icon images below.

![trainer map icon image #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/may_icon.png)
![trainer map icon image #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/red_icon.png)

The walk sprite is 144x32 pixels, split into 9 frames of 16x32 pixels each. 
Examples of valid walk sprites below:

![walk sprite #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/may_walk.png)
![walk sprite #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/red_walk.png)

The run sprite too is 144x32 pixels, split into 9 frames of 16x32 pixels each. However, depending on which "mode" it is read in, these frames will be assumed to be in different orders. The "RSE" mode assumes the same order as the frames in the walk sprite, while the "FRLG" mode assumes each "direction" is grouped together. Examples of valid run sprites below. The first run sprite is valid for "RSE" mode, and the second for "FRLG" mode:

![run sprite #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/may_run.png)
![run sprite #2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/red_run.png)

The bike sprite is 288x32 pixels, split into 9 frames of 32x32 pixels each. In RSE, this sprite is used for the Mach Bike. Examples of valid bike sprites below:

![bike sprite #1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wikipages/cpg/gen3/may_bike.png)

<!-- TODO: how does the indexing work? can you use a non-indexed walk image as long as the same 16 or less colors are used?? -->
All overworld sprites mentioned above share the same normal palette, and the same reflection palette. These are 16-colors palettes, of which the first color is "transparent". By default, the normal palette is derived from the walking image, and the reflection palette is a copy of the normal palette. However, they can also be assigned custom palettes through ".pal" files. Below is an example of a valid .pal file:

```
JASC-PAL
0100

148 230 230
255 238 213
255 213 213
