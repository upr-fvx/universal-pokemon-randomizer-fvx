## Make Evolutions Easier

In addition to lowering level evolutions, this setting also affects the following Pokemon:

**Always changed:**

* Inkay's evolution no longer requires that the console be held upside down.

**Only in Sun/Moon:**

* All Pokemon that normally evolve by levelling up in Vast Poni Canyon also evolve at level 35, in addition to their regular evolution method. This affects Magneton, Nosepass and Charjabug.
* Crabrawler also evolves at level 35, in addition to its regular evolution method.

**Only in Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon:**

* Normally, base form Rockruff evolves into Lycanroc-Midday or Lycanroc-Midnight (depending on the game), and Rockruff-OwnTempo evolves into Lycanroc-Dusk. This setting allows any Rockruff to evolve into any Lycanroc form, though game restrictions remain unless "remove impossible evolutions" is enabled.

**Only if Wild Pokemon are randomized:**

* Pokemon that evolve by having another specific Pokemon in the party now evolve at level 35 instead. This affects Mantyke, and if "Change Impossible Evolutions" is used, Shelmet and Karrablast.

## Remove Time-Based Evolutions

## "Follow Evolutions" Settings

For "Follow Evolutions" settings, traits will normally follow evolutions, but there are a few exceptional cases:

* For split evolutions (one Pokemon having several different evolutions), most traits will not follow to any of the evolutions. The reason for this is to make sure that the different evolutions are sufficiently different, while also preventing one evolution from being the "correct" one. The only exceptions to this are TM/HM compatibility and move tutor compatibility, which *will* follow all branches of the split evolution.
* For converging evolutions (several Pokemon evolving into one Pokemon), traits will follow for **one** of the evolution chains. When randomizing evolutions, converging evolutions are avoided as much as possible, but they may occur sometimes.
