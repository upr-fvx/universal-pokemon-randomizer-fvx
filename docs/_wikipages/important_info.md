This page contains information that is recommended for everyone who uses the randomizer to read.

The information here is only such information that takes up too much space to be in the program itself; if you're wondering what some setting in the randomizer does, you can hover your mouse over the setting in the program to get a pop-up description. Additional information about some settings can also be found on the other pages of this Wiki.

## EXP Curves and Evolutions

Experience (EXP) Curves are what determine how quickly a Pokemon levels up; there is a setting in the randomizer that can be used to standardize these for all Pokemon in a few different ways. However, EXP Curves have a less obvious side effect: **Pokemon can only evolve into Pokemon that have the same EXP Curve as themselves.** As such, standardizing EXP Curves will expand the pool of possible evolutions for all Pokemon (for some Pokemon, quite drastically - for example, [there are only 14 Pokemon with the Fluctuating EXP Curve,](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Category:Pok%C3%A9mon_in_the_Fluctuating_experience_group) so their random evolution possibilities are **very** limited if EXP Curves are not standardized).

## Quirks involving the "Follow Mega Evolutions" settings in Gen 7

In the Gen 7 games, the "Allow Alternate Formes" setting for evolutions allows a Pokemon to evolve directly into Mega Evolutions. As such, if you want to use that setting and also use "Follow Evolutions" settings to ensure that Pokemon don't change drastically upon evolution, it is recommended *not* to use "Follow Mega Evolutions" settings, as these take precedence. For example, if Poipole evolves into Mega Gengar, using "Follow Evolutions" for base stats means that Poipole and Mega Gengar will have the same base stat spreads. However, if "Follow Mega Evolutions" is used, Mega Gengar will instead have the same base stat spread as Gengar, meaning that when Poipole evolves, its stats will change drastically (even if "Follow Evolutions" is also used). Given that Mega Evolution only becomes available in the postgame of the Gen 7 games, the negative effects of not using "Follow Mega Evolutions" settings (i.e. Gengar getting a drastically different base stat spread when Mega Evolving) will likely not matter to you anyway.

## 3DS Game Randomization

Randomizing 3DS games is a bit more complicated than games on older consoles. [If you're unfamiliar with working with the various 3DS file formats, check out this page.]({{ site.baseurl }}/wikipages/3ds_games.html)
