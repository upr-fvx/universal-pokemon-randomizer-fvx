## Other Pokémon randomizers and UPR branches

The Universal Pokémon Randomizer is not the only tool for randomizing Pokémon games, and the FVX branch is not its only branch. 

Below, a small selection of other randomizers and branches are listed. They have been chosen for being notable and filling niches that the UPR or the FVX branch don't. However, there are more! See [The BIG List of Video Game Randomizers](https://randomizers.debigare.com/) for more non-UPR randomizers, and browse through forks on GitHub to find unmentioned branches. 

### Randomizers

- **[The Crystal Randofuser](https://github.com/xCrystal/crystal-randofuser)** (by xCrystal) is a randomizer for Pokémon Crystal, where Pokémon lines are fused when randomized. You no longer have Abra-Kadabra-Alakazam, Chikorita-Bayleef-Meganium - you have Chikabra-Baydabra-Megakazam! Or the like. 
- **[Sanqui's Online Randomizer](https://sanqui.net/randomizer/)** (by Sanqui) is not only an online randomizer for Pokémon Red, it adds new Pokémon species to the game, all the way up to Gen 6. 
- **[GBAXG](https://kittypboxx.github.io/GBAXG/)** (by KittyPBoxx) is a cross-game map randomizer of Pokémon FireRed, Emerald, and the Crystal Dust ROM hack. This does not mean it works on any of those given games - it works on all of them, *at once*. Travel between three regions seamlessly, and keep your team and items as you look for Gym Leaders and the Elite 4.
- **[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/)** is a so-called "multi-game" randomizer. Not only does it support many many games from disparate franchises, but it lets you combine them in a sense. Or if you don't feel up for that, the games can be randomized by their own. At the time of writing, Archipelago officially supports Pokémon [Red/Blue](https://archipelago.gg/games/Pokemon%20Red%20and%20Blue/info/en) and [Emerald](https://archipelago.gg/games/Pokemon%20Emerald/info/en), but more are likely to be added in the future. 

### Branches

- **[The Gaia Fork](https://github.com/sphericalice/universal-pokemon-randomizer)** (by Spherical Ice) branches off from the original UPR, and adds support to the popular Gaia ROM hack.
- **[brentspector's branch](https://github.com/brentspector/universal-pokemon-randomizer)** (by brentspector) branches off from the original UPR, and adds a number of features and tweaks, such as support for FireRed Randomizable 809. 
- **[Ironhidelvan's branch](https://github.com/IronhideIvan/universal-pokemon-randomizer-zx)** (by Ironhidelvan) branches off from ZX, and adds options to improve trades and trainer teams, among others.
- **Speedchoice branches** (by [Dabomstew](https://github.com/Dabomstew/UPR-Speedchoice), and [choatix](https://github.com/choatix/zxplus)) are ones that support Speedchoice ROM hacks. Since there are multiple branches with multiple releases each, each compatible with only some ROMs, finding the right Randomizer can be tricky. To solve this, Speedchoice communities tend to pack the relevant Randomizer with the download of the Speedchoice ROM itself.
