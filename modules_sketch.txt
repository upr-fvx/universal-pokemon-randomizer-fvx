Gradle allows for modular projects, and this presents an opportunity to separate
the already somewhat modularized code of the Randomizer, and enforce dependency relations
(e.g. making sure RomHandler code never depends on the Randomizer classes).

Below are sketches, for how it could be done.

        java.com.uprfvx.devtools
    [probably no tests for devtools]

random
    [would be nice to separate the GUI to yet another layer/subproject, but that's for later]
    main
        launcher
        java.com.uprfvx.random

roms
    [roms could arguably be under romio/test/resources... but then the random tests want to use them too.]
    [putting them outside of it all is a sort of compromise, but I am not certain how I feel about it]

== Module descriptions / dependency relations ==

docs:
    - The Randomizer's website, also holding the release notes.
    Documents everything. Not a strict code-wise dependency, but it needs to "know" about all other parts.

devtools:
    - Devtools, primarily for generating resources for romio.
    Depends on romio.
    Needs access to random/main/resources.

random:
    - The randomization logic, and also the GUI.
    Depends on romio.

romio:
    - The interface to the game files (ROMs).
    Depends on utils.

utils:
    - Various utilities such as compressors, most of them ports of external code.
    Depends on the Lunar Compress DLL (residing in utils/resources for now).
    Important the Lunar Compress DLL gets passed up.
