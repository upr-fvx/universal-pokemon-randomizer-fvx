If you are implementing a new setting, make sure you have added it
(or confirmed that it's unnecessary to add) to all the following location:

Settings.java:
    setting definition (variable and/or enum state)
    accessors (get, set) (if new variable)
    toString
    fromString
    LENGTH_OF_SETTINGS_DATA if adding a new byte
RandomizerGUI.form:
    add GUI element to select setting (not necessary if combobox option?)
bundle.properties:
    strings for setting label & tooltip
RandomizerGUI.java:
    initialState
    romLoaded
    restoreStateFromSettings
    createSettingsFromState
    enableOrDisableSubControls
    may also need to add action listeners to the constructor
SettingsUpdater.java:
    make update, if needed
Version.java:
    increase version number (and log old) if first feature in version
appropriate Randomizer:
    implement the actual effect
GameRandomizer.java:
    If adding a top-level setting, add method call.
Tests:
    Make at least one new unit test to verify the new setting works consistently
