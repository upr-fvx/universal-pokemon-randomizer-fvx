If you are implementing a new setting, make sure you have added it
(or confirmed that it's unnecessary to add) to all the following location:

### Settings.java:
* [ ] setting definition (variable and/or enum state)
* [ ] accessors (get, set) (if new variable)
* [ ] `toStringWithoutVersion`
* [ ] `fromStringWithoutVersion`
* [ ] `LENGTH_OF_SETTINGS_DATA` if adding a new byte
### RandomizerGUI.form:
* [ ] add GUI element to select setting (not necessary if combobox option?)
### Bundle.properties:
* [ ] strings for setting label & tooltip
### RandomizerGUI.java:
* [ ] `initialState`
* [ ] `romLoaded`
* [ ] `restoreStateFromSettings`
* [ ] `createSettingsFromState`
* [ ] `enableOrDisableSubControls`
* [ ] may also need to add action listeners to the constructor
### SettingsUpdater.java:
* [ ] make update, if needed
### Version.java:
* [ ] increase version number (and log old) if first feature in version
### appropriate Randomizer:
* [ ] implement the actual effect
### GameRandomizer.java:
* [ ] If adding a top-level setting, add method call.
### RandomizationLogger.java
* [ ] Add appropriate logging, if needed.
### Tests:
* [ ] Make at least one new unit test to verify the new setting works consistently.
### If a new property was added to a class:
* [ ] Make sure the property is supported in the RomHandlers, e.g., by the getters and setters.
* [ ] If necessary, make sure the property is properly copied during deep copies in the tests.
### Documentation
* [ ] Write a release note in `docs/_release_notes/release-note-next.md` following the template.
* [ ] Add yourself to the "Thanks to" section, at the top of the same file.
* [ ] If necessary, update affected pages in / add new pages to the wiki in `docs/_wikipages/`.

or to argue for what things do not have to be done.
