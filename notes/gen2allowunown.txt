# How to always enable encountering Unown / decouple them from the Ruins of Alph puzzle.

The relevant part are these lines in the ChooseWildEncounter routine:

```
	cp UNOWN
	jr nz, .done
	ld a, [wUnlockedUnowns]
	
	and a
	jr z, .nowildbattle
```
	
There are a couple of ways one could go about changing this, but the simplest one would
be to change the `jr nz, .done` into an unconditional `jr .done`. Let us figure out how 
far away `.done` is, by assemblind these instructions into hexcodes, and simply counting.
`.done` is just after this section, so that makes things even easier.

The [optable lookup](https://gbdev.io/gb-opcodes/optables/classic) is used when manually 
assembling.

```
FE XX      cp UNOWN
20 XX      jr nz, .done
FA XX XX   ld a, [wUnlockedUnowns]
	
A7         and a
28 XX      jr z, .nowildbattle

.done
```

`XX` are values we don't immediately know. The first one is trivially C9 though, because
Unown is Pokémon #201=C9 . And the second one is 06, by merit of counting bytes. We can fill these in, 
and get:

```
FE C9      cp UNOWN
20 06      jr nz, .done
FA XX XX   ld a, [wUnlockedUnowns]
```

These are 5 known bytes, which should be perfectly enough for finding the specific offset
by searching through ROM. Should the search turn out multiple offsets, we can either figure 
out `wUnlockedUnowns`, or intuit which one must be the correct one, by e.g. going off the bank. 

Ultimately, we want to find `FE C9 20 06 FA`, and change it to `FE C9 18 06 FA`. Because `18 06 == jr .done`.

However! Once we've done that we run into a problem: a black screen softlock as soon as a 
battle with an Unown starts. This is because there's another section which we need to change...
