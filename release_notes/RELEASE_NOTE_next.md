# Changelog
## New and Changed Features
<!-- Group features by the tabs by where they appear in the GUI. Namely, use the names of the boxed categories (not necessarily the same as the tab names) -->
<!-- Below are some example features. They are not expansive, because it is annoying to remove a dozen categories that don't have any new/changed features this release. -->
<!-- (Gen [N]) can be used to denote a feature or bugfix only is relevant when randomizing certain Generations, and (GUI) for GUI stuff. -->
