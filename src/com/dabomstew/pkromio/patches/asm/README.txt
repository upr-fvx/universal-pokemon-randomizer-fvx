Contains asm source code for the ips patches.

This placement is somewhat preliminary; it doesn't feel like the prettiest way of structuring this code,
but couldn't come up with something better. It is an improvement over where this dir was before: at root level.
If you got a better idea, make a suggestion!

It's worth noting that ips patches have seen little attention lately
(because I don't like them and am the only low level dev atm ^^;),
hard-coded solutions in Java being preferred. So all of this is old-ish code,
and that isn't likely to change soon.
